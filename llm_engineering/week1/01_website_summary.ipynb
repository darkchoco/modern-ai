      "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\n",

      "For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\n",
      "We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video.\n",

Noam proposed scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention and the parameter-free position representation and became the other person involved in nearly every detail. Niki designed, implemented, tuned and evaluated countless model variants in our original codebase and tensor2tensor. Llion also experimented with novel model variants, was responsible for our initial codebase, and efficient inference and visualizations. Lukasz and Aidan spent countless long days designing various parts of and implementing tensor2tensor, replacing our earlier codebase, greatly improving results and massively accelerating our research.\n",

      "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\n",

      "For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\n",
      "We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video.\n",

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nand gated recurrent\\n[\\n7\\n]\\nneural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation\\n[\\n35\\n,\\n2\\n,\\n5\\n]\\n. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures\\n[\\n38\\n,\\n24\\n,\\n15\\n]\\n.\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states\\nh\\nt\\nsubscript\\nℎ\\n𝑡\\nh_{t}\\nitalic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\\n, as a function of the previous hidden state\\nh\\nt\\n−\\n1\\nsubscript\\nℎ\\n𝑡\\n1\\nh_{t-1}\\nitalic_h start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t - 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\\nand the input for position\\nt\\n𝑡\\nt\\nitalic_t\\n. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.\\nRecent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nand conditional computation\\n[\\n32\\n]\\n, while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences\\n[\\n2\\n,\\n19\\n]\\n. In all but a few cases\\n[\\n27\\n]\\n, however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[\\n16\\n]\\n, ByteNet\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nand ConvS2S\\n[\\n9\\n]\\n, all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions\\n[\\n12\\n]\\n. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section\\n3.2\\n.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations\\n[\\n4\\n,\\n27\\n,\\n28\\n,\\n22\\n]\\n.\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks\\n[\\n34\\n]\\n.\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution.\\nIn the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as\\n[\\n17\\n,\\n18\\n]\\nand\\n[\\n9\\n]\\n.\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nFigure 1:\\nThe Transformer - model architecture.\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure\\n[\\n5\\n,\\n2\\n,\\n35\\n]\\n. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations\\n(\\nx\\n1\\n,\\n…\\n,\\nx\\nn\\n)\\nsubscript\\n𝑥\\n1\\n…\\nsubscript\\n𝑥\\n𝑛\\n(x_{1},...,x_{n})\\n( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , … , italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT )\\nto a sequence of continuous representations\\n𝐳\\n=\\n(\\nz\\n1\\n,\\n…\\n,\\nz\\nn\\n)\\n𝐳\\nsubscript\\n𝑧\\n1\\n…\\nsubscript\\n𝑧\\n𝑛\\n\\\\mathbf{z}=(z_{1},...,z_{n})\\nbold_z = ( italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , … , italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT )\\n. Given\\n𝐳\\n𝐳\\n\\\\mathbf{z}\\nbold_z\\n, the decoder then generates an output sequence\\n(\\ny\\n1\\n,\\n…\\n,\\ny\\nm\\n)\\nsubscript\\n𝑦\\n1\\n…\\nsubscript\\n𝑦\\n𝑚\\n(y_{1},...,y_{m})\\n( italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , … , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m end_POSTSUBSCRIPT )\\nof symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[\\n10\\n]\\n, consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure\\n1\\n, respectively.\\n3.1\\nEncoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of\\nN\\n=\\n6\\n𝑁\\n6\\nN=6\\nitalic_N = 6\\nidentical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection\\n[\\n11\\n]\\naround each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization\\n[\\n1\\n]\\n. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm\\n\\u2062\\n(\\nx\\n+\\nSublayer\\n\\u2062\\n(\\nx\\n)\\n)\\nLayerNorm\\n𝑥\\nSublayer\\n𝑥\\n\\\\mathrm{LayerNorm}(x+\\\\mathrm{Sublayer}(x))\\nroman_LayerNorm ( italic_x + roman_Sublayer ( italic_x ) )\\n, where\\nSublayer\\n\\u2062\\n(\\nx\\n)\\nSublayer\\n𝑥\\n\\\\mathrm{Sublayer}(x)\\nroman_Sublayer ( italic_x )\\nis the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension\\nd\\nmodel\\n=\\n512\\nsubscript\\n𝑑\\nmodel\\n512\\nd_{\\\\text{model}}=512\\nitalic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 512\\n.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of\\nN\\n=\\n6\\n𝑁\\n6\\nN=6\\nitalic_N = 6\\nidentical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position\\ni\\n𝑖\\ni\\nitalic_i\\ncan depend only on the known outputs at positions less than\\ni\\n𝑖\\ni\\nitalic_i\\n.\\n3.2\\nAttention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure\\n2\\n). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension\\nd\\nk\\nsubscript\\n𝑑\\n𝑘\\nd_{k}\\nitalic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\\n, and values of dimension\\nd\\nv\\nsubscript\\n𝑑\\n𝑣\\nd_{v}\\nitalic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_v end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\\n. We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by\\nd\\nk\\nsubscript\\n𝑑\\n𝑘\\n\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}\\nsquare-root start_ARG italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG\\n, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix\\nQ\\n𝑄\\nQ\\nitalic_Q\\n. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices\\nK\\n𝐾\\nK\\nitalic_K\\nand\\nV\\n𝑉\\nV\\nitalic_V\\n. We compute the matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention\\n\\u2062\\n(\\nQ\\n,\\nK\\n,\\nV\\n)\\n=\\nsoftmax\\n\\u2062\\n(\\nQ\\n\\u2062\\nK\\nT\\nd\\nk\\n)\\n\\u2062\\nV\\nAttention\\n𝑄\\n𝐾\\n𝑉\\nsoftmax\\n𝑄\\nsuperscript\\n𝐾\\n𝑇\\nsubscript\\n𝑑\\n𝑘\\n𝑉\\n\\\\mathrm{Attention}(Q,K,V)=\\\\mathrm{softmax}(\\\\frac{QK^{T}}{\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}})V\\nroman_Attention ( italic_Q , italic_K , italic_V ) = roman_softmax ( divide start_ARG italic_Q italic_K start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG square-root start_ARG italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG end_ARG ) italic_V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention\\n[\\n2\\n]\\n, and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of\\n1\\nd\\nk\\n1\\nsubscript\\n𝑑\\n𝑘\\n\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}}\\ndivide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG square-root start_ARG italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG end_ARG\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of\\nd\\nk\\nsubscript\\n𝑑\\n𝑘\\nd_{k}\\nitalic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\\nthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of\\nd\\nk\\nsubscript\\n𝑑\\n𝑘\\nd_{k}\\nitalic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\\n[\\n3\\n]\\n. We suspect that for large values of\\nd\\nk\\nsubscript\\n𝑑\\n𝑘\\nd_{k}\\nitalic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\\n, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nTo illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of\\nq\\n𝑞\\nq\\nitalic_q\\nand\\nk\\n𝑘\\nk\\nitalic_k\\nare independent random variables with mean\\n0\\n0\\nand variance\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n.

This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[\\n38\\n,\\n2\\n,\\n9\\n]\\n.\\n•\\nThe encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.\\n•\\nSimilarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to\\n−\\n∞\\n-\\\\infty\\n- ∞\\n) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure\\n2\\n.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN\\n\\u2062\\n(\\nx\\n)\\n=\\nmax\\n\\u2061\\n(\\n0\\n,\\nx\\n\\u2062\\nW\\n1\\n+\\nb\\n1\\n)\\n\\u2062\\nW\\n2\\n+\\nb\\n2\\nFFN\\n𝑥\\n0\\n𝑥\\nsubscript\\n𝑊\\n1\\nsubscript\\n𝑏\\n1\\nsubscript\\n𝑊\\n2\\nsubscript\\n𝑏\\n2\\n\\\\mathrm{FFN}(x)=\\\\max(0,xW_{1}+b_{1})W_{2}+b_{2}\\nroman_FFN ( italic_x ) = roman_max ( 0 , italic_x italic_W start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + italic_b start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) italic_W start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + italic_b start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.

We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to\\n[\\n30\\n]\\n. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by\\nd\\nmodel\\nsubscript\\n𝑑\\nmodel\\n\\\\sqrt{d_{\\\\text{model}}}\\nsquare-root start_ARG italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG\\n.\\n3.5\\nPositional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension\\nd\\nmodel\\nsubscript\\n𝑑\\nmodel\\nd_{\\\\text{model}}\\nitalic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT model end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed.

We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(\\nx\\n1\\n,\\n…\\n,\\nx\\nn\\n)\\nsubscript\\n𝑥\\n1\\n…\\nsubscript\\n𝑥\\n𝑛\\n(x_{1},...,x_{n})\\n( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , … , italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT )\\nto another sequence of equal length\\n(\\nz\\n1\\n,\\n…\\n,\\nz\\nn\\n)\\nsubscript\\n𝑧\\n1\\n…\\nsubscript\\n𝑧\\n𝑛\\n(z_{1},...,z_{n})\\n( italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , … , italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT )\\n, with\\nx\\ni\\n,\\nz\\ni\\n∈\\nℝ\\nd\\nsubscript\\n𝑥\\n𝑖\\nsubscript\\n𝑧\\n𝑖\\nsuperscript\\nℝ\\n𝑑\\nx_{i},z_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\nitalic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∈ blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT\\n, such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer.\\nAnother is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies\\n[\\n12\\n]\\n. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\\nTable 1:\\nMaximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types.\\nn\\n𝑛\\nn\\nitalic_n\\nis the sequence length,\\nd\\n𝑑\\nd\\nitalic_d\\nis the representation dimension,\\nk\\n𝑘\\nk\\nitalic_k\\nis the kernel size of convolutions and\\nr\\n𝑟\\nr\\nitalic_r\\nthe size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type\\nComplexity per Layer\\nSequential\\nMaximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention\\nO\\n\\u2062\\n(\\nn\\n2\\n⋅\\nd\\n)\\n𝑂\\n⋅\\nsuperscript\\n𝑛\\n2\\n𝑑\\nO(n^{2}\\\\cdot d)\\nitalic_O ( italic_n start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ⋅ italic_d )\\nO\\n\\u2062\\n(\\n1\\n)\\n𝑂\\n1\\nO(1)\\nitalic_O ( 1 )\\nO\\n\\u2062\\n(\\n1\\n)\\n𝑂\\n1\\nO(1)\\nitalic_O ( 1 )\\nRecurrent\\nO\\n\\u2062\\n(\\nn\\n⋅\\nd\\n2\\n)\\n𝑂\\n⋅\\n𝑛\\nsuperscript\\n𝑑\\n2\\nO(n\\\\cdot d^{2})\\nitalic_O ( italic_n ⋅ italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT )\\nO\\n\\u2062\\n(\\nn\\n)\\n𝑂\\n𝑛\\nO(n)\\nitalic_O ( italic_n )\\nO\\n\\u2062\\n(\\nn\\n)\\n𝑂\\n𝑛\\nO(n)\\nitalic_O ( italic_n )\\nConvolutional\\nO\\n\\u2062\\n(\\nk\\n⋅\\nn\\n⋅\\nd\\n2\\n)\\n𝑂\\n⋅\\n𝑘\\n𝑛\\nsuperscript\\n𝑑\\n2\\nO(k\\\\cdot n\\\\cdot d^{2})\\nitalic_O ( italic_k ⋅ italic_n ⋅ italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT )\\nO\\n\\u2062\\n(\\n1\\n)\\n𝑂\\n1\\nO(1)\\nitalic_O ( 1 )\\nO\\n\\u2062\\n(\\nl\\n\\u2062\\no\\n\\u2062\\ng\\nk\\n\\u2062\\n(\\nn\\n)\\n)\\n𝑂\\n𝑙\\n𝑜\\nsubscript\\n𝑔\\n𝑘\\n𝑛\\nO(log_{k}(n))\\nitalic_O ( italic_l italic_o italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_n ) )\\nSelf-Attention (restricted)\\nO\\n\\u2062\\n(\\nr\\n⋅\\nn\\n⋅\\nd\\n)\\n𝑂\\n⋅\\n𝑟\\n𝑛\\n𝑑\\nO(r\\\\cdot n\\\\cdot d)\\nitalic_O ( italic_r ⋅ italic_n ⋅ italic_d )\\nO\\n\\u2062\\n(\\n1\\n)\\n𝑂\\n1\\nO(1)\\nitalic_O ( 1 )\\nO\\n\\u2062\\n(\\nn\\n/\\nr\\n)\\n𝑂\\n𝑛\\n𝑟\\nO(n/r)\\nitalic_O ( italic_n / italic_r )\\nAs noted in Table\\n1\\n, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires\\nO\\n\\u2062\\n(\\nn\\n)\\n𝑂\\n𝑛\\nO(n)\\nitalic_O ( italic_n )\\nsequential operations.\\nIn terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length\\nn\\n𝑛\\nn\\nitalic_n\\nis smaller than the representation dimensionality\\nd\\n𝑑\\nd\\nitalic_d\\n, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[\\n38\\n]\\nand byte-pair\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nrepresentations.\\nTo improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size\\nr\\n𝑟\\nr\\nitalic_r\\nin the input sequence centered around the respective output position.

We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5\\nTraining\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1\\nTraining Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding\\n[\\n3\\n]\\n, which has a shared source-target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary\\n[\\n38\\n]\\n. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens.\\n5.2\\nHardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the bottom line of table\\n3\\n), step time was 1.0 seconds.

We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table\\n3\\n.\\nIn Table\\n3\\nrows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section\\n3.2.2\\n. While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\nIn Table\\n3\\nrows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size\\nd\\nk\\nsubscript\\n𝑑\\n𝑘\\nd_{k}\\nitalic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\\nhurts model quality. This suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings\\n[\\n9\\n]\\n, and observe nearly identical results to the base model.\\n6.3\\nEnglish Constituency Parsing\\nTable 4:\\nThe Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23 of WSJ)\\nParser\\nTraining\\nWSJ 23 F1\\nVinyals & Kaiser el al.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video.\\nMaking generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at\\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor\\n.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for\\ntheir fruitful comments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1]\\nJimmy\\xa0Lei Ba, Jamie\\xa0Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey\\xa0E Hinton.\\nLayer normalization.\\narXiv preprint arXiv:1607.06450\\n, 2016.\\n[2]\\nDzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio.\\nNeural machine translation by jointly learning to align and\\ntranslate.\\nCoRR\\n, abs/1409.0473, 2014.\\n[3]\\nDenny Britz, Anna Goldie, Minh-Thang Luong, and Quoc\\xa0V.

       "# Summary of \"Attention Is All You Need\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The \"Attention Is All You Need\" website provides an in-depth overview of a groundbreaking model architecture known as the Transformer, which leverages attention mechanisms in place of recurrent or convolutional neural networks. The transformer architecture significantly enhances the efficiency of sequence transduction tasks, such as machine translation.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Key Sections Overview\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1. Introduction\n",
       "The introduction discusses the limitations of traditional recurrent and convolutional models in handling sequence tasks efficiently and introduces the Transformer as a solution that relies solely on attention mechanisms.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. Background\n",
       "This section explains the need for mechanisms that can model long-range dependencies in sequences without the constraints posed by the sequential computation of RNNs. \n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. Model Architecture\n",
       "The Transformer is built using:\n",
       "- **Encoder and Decoder Stacks**: Comprising self-attention layers and feed-forward networks.\n",
       "- **Attention Mechanisms**: Including scaled dot-product attention and multi-head attention that allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously.\n",
       "- **Positional Encoding**: Since the model does not contain recurrence, positional encodings are added to inject information about the order of input tokens.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. Why Self-Attention?\n",
       "Self-attention is highlighted as a critical innovation, as it connects all positions in a sequence, allowing efficient parallelization and distinguishing it from previous architectures.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 5. Training\n",
       "Details about the training process are provided, including data sources, batching strategies, hardware specifications, and optimization methods. Regularization techniques such as dropout and label smoothing are also discussed.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 6. Results\n",
       "The training results demonstrate that the Transformer outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in machine translation tasks:\n",
       "- Achieving BLEU scores of 28.4 for English-to-German and 41.8 for English-to-French translations, with significantly reduced training times. \n",
       "- Results for English constituency parsing also show competitive performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 7. Conclusion\n",
       "The paper emphasizes the efficacy of the Transformer for translation tasks and expresses excitement about extending attention-based models to other modalities beyond text.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Acknowledgements\n",
       "Attributions are given to contributors of the research and model development.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Notable Achievements\n",
       "The Transformer establishes new benchmarks in machine translation while being notably faster and more efficient compared to its predecessors. It opens avenues for future explorations in various input-output modalities beyond text-centric applications. \n",
       "\n",
       "The research details and code are publicly available for further experimentation and application."
